This private\n  license lets you use my contributions to the project for\n  commercial purposes, and to create software not released\n  as open source.  However, this private license applies\n  only to you, and in a limited way to those you're allowed\n  to sublicense.\n\nNo Liability\n\n  My contributions to the project come as is, without any\n  warranty at all.  As far as the law allows, I will not be\n  liable for any damages related to the project or this\n  license, for any kind of legal claim.\n\nScope\n\n  This private license covers contributions I have made to\n  the project with the identifier in package metadata,\n  and any contributions I make to the project in the future\n  without changing the identifier or adding a new one.  This\n  private license does not cover contributions I make to the\n  project in the future with a different or additional\n  identifier.\n\nCopyright License\n\n  Subject to the other terms of this license, I grant you a\n  perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,\n  irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare\n  derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\n  and distribute my contributions to the project, in source\n  code or any other form.\n\nRedistribution\n\n  You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of the\n  project from you, in source code or any other form, also\n  gets the complete texts of the public licenses for my\n  contributions to the project, including copyright and\n  source notices.\n\nPatent License\n\n  Subject to the other terms of this license, I grant you a\n  perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,\n  irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer\n  to sell, import, and otherwise transfer the project.  That\n  license applies only to patent claims I can license that\n  are necessarily infringed by my contributions alone, or by\n  combination of my contributions with the project as it was\n  when I submitted my contributions.\n\nDefensive Termination\n\n  If you make any legal claim against anyone for infringing\n  any patent claim they would infringe by using the project\n  alone, accusing the project, with or without changes,\n  alone or combined into a larger program, then your patent\n  license automatically terminates.\n\nSublicensing\n\n  If you combine the project with other software into a\n  larger program, you may sublicense my contributions to the\n  project as part of your larger program, and allow further\n  sublicensing in turn, on these conditions:\n\n  1. Your larger program must have significant additional\n     content or functionality beyond that of the project,\n     and end users must license your larger program\n     primarily for that additional content or functionality.\n\n  2. Sublicenses must not permit anything that would violate\n     the public license for my contributions to the project,\n     other than as part of your larger program.\n\n  3. Sublicenses must permit copying and adaptation\n     necessary for utilization of the program, archiving,\n     maintenance, and repair, as described in United State\n     Code title 17, section 117.\n\n  4. The conditions in No Liability, Defensive Termination,\n     Sublicensing, and Redistribution must apply to each\n     sublicense.\n\n  You may create, and sublicense for, as many larger\n  programs as you like.\n","publicKey":"1589d5a1b9b6b6ca26515b65fe9f725410c9f7fa41bcd9954a84d76f47cc6482","signature":"0da393a1d4ee52d05600b47048cbfb28a26ee0a0a10cf3600cd8fad4c270701d53dc07599b4b9f2475a182e45a4c276ec62b6e0db025787c64fc558d99719000"}
